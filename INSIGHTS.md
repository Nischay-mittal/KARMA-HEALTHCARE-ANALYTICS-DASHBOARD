Key Business Insights from Sales Data (Last 6 Months) :

1) Electronics is clearly the strongest category

Electronics produces 70–90% of total revenue in most months.
The best-selling product Laptop LightBook 14 alone generates ₹219,996, dwarfing products from other categories.

Business implication: Electronics should remain a core focus area; potential to expand stock, increase marketing budget, and introduce EMI offers.

2) Revenue shows strong seasonality  (growth spikes followed by drops)

For example, between April and May, revenue increases sharply.
Then there is a dip in June/July and recovery afterward.

Possible reasons:
- Festive buying patterns
- Salary-cycle buying (monthly salary periods)

Promotional months Recommendation: Identify the drivers for peak months and replicate campaigns.

3) High customer concentration risk (heavy reliance on a few buyers)

Top 2 customers contribute >70% of all spending.
Remaining customers contribute significantly less.

Business implication: Losing one major customer would materially hurt revenue.
Recommendation: Increase customer-base diversification via referral offers or bundled discounts.

4) MoM Growth is highly volatile

Growth percentage swings from positive to deeply negative.

Example:
- April to May: strong growth
- May to June: large drop

Implication: Demand is unstable.
Actionable step: Implement subscription packages or loyalty programs for stable recurring sales.

5) Books and Apparel have potential but lack volume

Books & Apparel show consistently low revenue despite existing demand.
Opportunity: Expand product variety
